# Hencham V2
## Your studio sidekick

The henchman helps you slate ROMs correctly when working in a pipelined enviroment, or with heavily pipelined clients.
It also helps navigate capture sessions, and separates your ROMs, Calibrations, and actual capture data.
When executing challenging shoots (Rocklock!), which require separated and recorded calibration steps these can be slate and managed.

## Future Improvements

* Maybe act as a remote control for the whole capture and calibration process?
* Since wand-waves to a chosen file are lost, we may need to kick off a 'bladeCL' instance to run offline calibration steps.

## Important !!
I've found that using the 'CDE' Look and feel gives you the most compact interface, so run henchman like this:

`python henchman.py -style cde`
